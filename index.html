                <h2>Description of Project Ideas</h2>
                <p>
                    The idea I have for my project is to create a resume website. This would show my skills as a web designer, while also displaying any relevant content from my resume and acting as a portfolio for any work I have done. While simply displaying my resume in the form of a website on its own would be fairly simple, I would like to try to come up with a unique way of organizing the information using javascript sliders and other tools, while still keeping things looking clean and professional.<br><br>
    
                    I would like to make this a single page site, with some links to examples of work I have completed and to relevant social media accounts (mainly LinkedIn). Creating a slick navigation and displaying so much information without changing the page will present an additional challenge to overcome, but it will look impressive if done well.<br><br>
    
                    I also plan to ensure this page is accessible, so I will be looking into various accessibility standards, including considerations like alt text for images, proper element organization and roles, and color contrast.
